# 1. Real-world scenario
# ○ The project should use a real-world dataset and include a reference of their source in the report (10)
# Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india?select=covid_19_india.csv


# 2. Importing data
# ○ Your project should make use of one or more of the following: Relational database, API or web scraping (10)
# ○ Import a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame (10)



# 3. Analysing data
# ○ Your project should use Regex to extract a pattern in data (10)
# ○ Replace missing values or drop duplicates (10)
# ○ Make use of iterators (10)
# ○ Merge DataFrames (10)
# 4. Python
# ○ Define a custom function to create reusable code (10)
# ○ NumPy (10)
# ○ Dictionary or Lists (10)
# 5. Machine Learning (60)
# ○ Predict a target variable with Supervised or Unsupervised algorithm
# ○ You are free to choose any algorithm
# ○ Perform hyper parameter tuning or boosting, whichever is relevant to your model. If it is not relevant, justify that in your report and Python comments
# 6. Visualise
# ○ Present two charts with Seaborn or Matplotlib (20)
# 7. Generate valuable insights
# ○ 5 insights from the project (20)
